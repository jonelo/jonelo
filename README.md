# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my source code repositories on GitHub!

I am Johann N. LÃ¶fflmann from Munich, Germany.  I hold an university degree in Information Technology from an University of Applied Sciences. I am Ex-Sun Microsystems, Ex-Oracle. I was supporting Java SE on the 3rd level at those companies for many of their customers, worldwide. I am SCJP, SCJD, and OCP Java SE certified. My motto: "people rarely succeed until they have fun in what they are doing".

Well, I still love to code (not only) in Java, and I am pleased to host the source code for some of my OSI certified open source software here on GitHub.
